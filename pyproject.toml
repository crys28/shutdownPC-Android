description = "This app is designed to remotely shut down PCs via SSH, providing a straightforward interface to manage and control multiple computers. Technologies used - Python (primary development language); JSON (for data storage); Toga (BeeWare)- A cross-platform library used to create the graphical user interface, making the app work natively on both desktop and Android environments; Paramiko- A Python SSH library for secure, password-based remote connections to each PC; Briefcase (BeeWare)- For packaging the app across multiple platforms, including Android."
